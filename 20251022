# 1. Write a function to split a given string on hyphens (-) and display each substring on a new line.
# You must:
# - Solve it using an inbuilt function (split()).
# - Solve it without using any inbuilt split functions â€” by using loops and conditions.
# Given:
# sentence = "Emma-is-a-data-scientist"
# Expected Output:
# Emma
# is
# a
# data
# scientist

# def split_without_inbuilt(text, delimiter='-'):
#     result = ""  
#     for char in text:

#         if char == delimiter:
#             print(result)
#             result = ""
#         else:
            
#             result += char
#     if result:
#         print(result)

# # --- Execution ---
# print("\n--- Without using inbuilt split() ---")
# split_without_inbuilt(sentence)

# 2. Write a Python program to reverse a given string in two ways:
# str1 = "Python"
# reversed_str2 = ""
# for char in str1:
#     reversed_str2 = char + reversed_str2
# print("Reversed without slicing:", reversed_str2)

# 3. Write a Python program to count the number of consonants in a given string.

# text = "Hello World"
# consonants = "bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyzBCDFGHJKLMNPQRSTVWXYZ"
# count = 0
# for char in text:
#     if char in consonants:
#         count += 1
# print("\nNumber of consonants:", count)

# 4.  Write a Python program to remove all spaces from a given string.

# input = "Python is awesome"
# no_spaces = ""
# for char in input:
#     if char != " ":
#         no_spaces += char
# print("\nString without spaces:", no_spaces)

# 5. Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a password and checks if it is strong. A password is considered strong if:
# It has at least 8 characters and  atleast one special character (!@#$%^&*).
# Print whether the password is strong or not.

# password = input("\nEnter your password: ")
# special_chars = "!@#$%^&*"
# if len(password) >= 8 and any(char in special_chars for char in password):
#     print("Password is strong")
# else:
#     print("Password is not strong")
